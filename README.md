# **Overview**

This repository is part of a project that includes reproducing the bioinformatics RNA sequencing analysis workflow for the paper: Leveraging transcription factors to speed cellobiose fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-014-0126-6 

The original 2014 study engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae with non-native cellobiose to optimise fermentation rate in comparison with native glucose. This project aimed to verify reported differential gene expressions with NGS and access the reproducibility of this documented workflow.
